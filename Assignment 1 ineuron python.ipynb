In addition to letters, they can also include numbers, spaces, punctuation, and even line breaks (using ‘\\n’ for new line). Strings can not be used for calculation (even if your string is just a number like ‘5’), you would have to convert it to a number data type first to perform math operations on it. ex: s ='data'\n",
    "#### Variable: simply variables that stores the information in the form of values. A variable is basically the name of the location in the primary memory of your computer. This can be chosen by you. A variable can store everything from strings to numbers. ex: var=56"
